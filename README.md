# YASE
Yet Another Simulation Engine

This is a super simple playback simulator that uses JSON files as tempalte for the simulation that need to playback.
It's actually a proof of concept. No garantuee that works...

It's a "core" class library that simplify event playback....     and a couple of sample console applications.

One generates a sample JSON file    the other playback it and stream into Event Hub
